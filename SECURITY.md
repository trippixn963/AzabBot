# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Considerations

This Discord bot handles user data and interactions. Please be aware of the following security considerations:

## 🛡️ Data Handling

### What Data is Stored
- **User Messages**: Stored locally in SQLite database
- **User IDs**: For tracking and identification
- **Interaction History**: For AI response context
- **Mute Reasons**: Extracted from Discord embeds

### Data Privacy
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally, not sent to external servers
- **No Personal Info**: Only Discord usernames and message content
- **Temporary Data**: Mute reasons stored temporarily for context

## ⚠️ Security Warnings

### API Keys
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Rotate keys regularly** for security

### Discord Permissions
- **Minimal Permissions**: Bot only requests necessary permissions
- **Channel Restrictions**: Can be limited to specific channels
- **Role-Based Access**: Commands require administrator permissions

### Input Validation
- **Message Sanitization**: All user input is validated
- **Length Limits**: Message content is truncated to prevent abuse
