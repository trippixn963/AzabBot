Azab Discord Bot - AI Service Module
===================================

OpenAI integration for generating contextual AI responses to Discord messages.
Provides intelligent ragebaiting responses for muted users and general
sarcastic responses for regular users.

Features:
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo integration
- Contextual response generation based on user status
- Special ragebaiting responses for muted users
- Fallback responses when AI is unavailable
- Async API calls for non-blocking operation
