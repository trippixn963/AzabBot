Azab Discord Bot - AI Service Module
===================================

OpenAI integration for generating contextual AI responses to Discord messages.
Provides intelligent ragebaiting responses for muted users and conversational
responses for family members.

Features:
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo integration with usage tracking
- Contextual response generation based on user status and history
- Special ragebaiting responses for muted users
- Intelligent conversations with family members (dad, uncle, brother)
- Database query integration for real-time statistics
- Conversation memory (last 10 messages)
- Dynamic roasting based on mute duration and repeat offenses
- Fallback responses when AI is unavailable
- Async API calls for non-blocking operation
- Input validation and sanitization
